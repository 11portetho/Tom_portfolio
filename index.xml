      <description>This project provides an introduction to cluster analysis along with an example of its application on the MNIST dataset: a collection of 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0-9. We discuss three methods of clustering: K-means, OPTICS and the Gaussian mixture model (and Expectation Maximisation algorithm) before describing principal component analysis, a common method used for data compression. These methods are subsequently applied to the MNIST dataset with their efficacy being evaluated using a number of both internal and external methods.</description>

      <description>Nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration unanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and when he reached that untoward conclusion: “As soon as his illustrious eminence, the cardinal, arrives, we will begin,” his voice was drowned in a thunder of hooting.
“Begin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!” shrieked the people. And above all the voices, that of Johannes de Molendino was audible, piercing the uproar like the fife’s derisive serenade: “Commence instantly!</description>

      <description>A passion for problem solving and analytical thinking led me to undertake a BSc in Mathematics at Durham. Whilst there, I developed an interest in statistics which gave me an introduction to machine learning and data science. During the initial Covid lockdown, I decided to learn more about these subjects, so I started playing around with some machine learning models in Python. I was particularly intrigued by unsupervised learning; how it could be used to draw meaning from seemingly useless unlabeled datasets.</description>
