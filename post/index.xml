      <description>Introduction This project provides an introduction to cluster analysis along with an example of its application on the MNIST dataset: a collection of 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0-9. We discuss three methods of clustering: K-means, OPTICS and the Gaussian mixture model (and Expectation Maximisation algorithm) before describing principal component analysis, a common method used for data compression. These methods are subsequently applied to the MNIST dataset with their efficacy being evaluated using a number of both internal and external methods.</description>

“Begin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!” shrieked the people. And above all the voices, that of Johannes de Molendino was audible, piercing the uproar like the fife’s derisive serenade: “Commence instantly!</description>
